# Stack Operations Example

This directory contains a complete implementation of a static stack in C, demonstrating basic stack operations.

## File Description

- `basic_stack_operations.c`: The main code file that implements a static stack with the following operations:
  - `push`: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  - `pop`: Remove and return the top element of the stack.
  - `peek`: View the top element of the stack without removing it.
  - `is_empty`: Check if the stack is empty.
  - `is_full`: Check if the stack is full.

## Features

- Displays the status of the stack and the actions performed.
- User-friendly terminal interface to interact with the stack operations.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the code, run:
```bash
gcc -o stack_operations basic-basic_stack_operations.c
